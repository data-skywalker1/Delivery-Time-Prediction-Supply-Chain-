# 📦 Delivery Time Prediction using Neural Networks

This project builds a deep learning regression model to **predict parcel delivery time** in a supply chain/logistics setting. The model uses features such as order details, store category, delivery partner availability, and operational load to estimate delivery duration accurately.

## 🧠 Model Highlights

- ✅ Built with **Keras** and optimized using **Keras Tuner**
- ⚙️ Key features include:
  - Order details (item count, price range, protocol)
  - Delivery conditions (partners on shift, outstanding orders)
  - Store metadata (category, location)
  - Time-based features (hour of day, day of week)
